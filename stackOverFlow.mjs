/**
 * Recursive Call:
    * it is a function calls itself to solve a problem
    * its purpose is to break a big problem into smaller easier pieces
 * How It Works:
    * calls itself with a simpler version of the problem
 * stops when it reaches a simple case (base case)
 * example: 
    * finding factorial: 5! = 5 * 4!, 4! = 4 * 3!, and so on
 * Advantages: 
    * simplifies code for certain problems
 * Limitations: 
    * can cause a stack overflow if thereâ€™s no base case or if recursion is too deep
